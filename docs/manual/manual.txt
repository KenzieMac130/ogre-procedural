== About this manual

This manual aims to give a global view over what is possible with Ogre Procedural.
If you need more detailed information about how to use a specific functionality, please refer to the doxygen doc.

== Mesh primitives

There are a few mesh primitives generators.

.Cube

.RoundedCube

.Sphere

.IcoSphere

Icosphere is visually quite near from Sphere, but has a quite different repartition of the triangles.

.Torus

.TorusKnot

.Cylinder

.Cone

.Tube

.Capsule


== Shapes, paths and tracks

In Ogre Procedural, shapes, paths and tracks all are made of line connected points.

The difference between them is that :
* Tracks are 1D
* Shapes are 2D
* Paths are 3D

=== Orientation and closedness

Both shapes and tracks can be closed or not : if closed, there will be an automatic junction between the last point and the first point.

Shapes have an outside and an inside : you can define whether the left or the right side is the outside.
It also makes sense with non-closed shape (for example, when extruded, the outside corresponds to where the face normal heads).
There's also a function to guess where is the outside and where is the inside.

=== Splines

Splines are a few helper classes used to generate tracks, shapes or paths, by interpolating between a bunch of control points.

.Cubic Hermite Spline

This is often referred as 'Bezier Spline'.
With Cubic Hermite Spline, you can choose the points and the tangents of the curves that goes through control points.

.Catmull-Rom Spline

It's a particular case of Cubic Hermite Spline, in which tangents are automatically calculated.

.Konachek Bartels Spline

=== Special operations

==== 2D CSG

==== Thicken

== Extrusion and lathe

Extrusion is an operation that consists in creating a mesh from a shape moved along a path.
